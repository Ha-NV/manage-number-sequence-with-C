# manage_number_sequence_withC
This program allows the user to create, manipulate, and perform operations on an number-sequence. The user can create an array, print it, insert elements, delete elements, sort it in ascending or descending order, and find a specific number within the array.

When running the program, a user guide will appear with the program's features:
- Enter 'c' to create an integer array (If you already have an array, clear the data of the old array).
- Enter 'p' to print the range (If the range does not have a value, report the range as empty).
- Enter 'i' to add 1 element to the kth position range decided by the user.
- Enter 'd' to delete an element at the kth position (If position k does not contain a value, it says there is no element k).
- Enter 's' to sort the series of numbers in ascending order.
- Enter 'x' to sort in descending order.
- Enter 't' to search for a number x in the range (x entered from the keyboard)?
- If you enter 'e', the program exits.
